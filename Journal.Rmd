# Patrick's Journal 
Made to keep a record of my practice with coding by displaying my practice code questions, answers and future pieces of code



# Problem 1

Do simple math with numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

```{r}
1+2
2*5
5/3
(1+6+4)/5

```

# Problem 2

Put numbers into variables, do simple math on the variables

```{r}
a<-1
b<-2
a+b

d<-c(1,2,3)
e<-c(5,6,7)
d+e
d*e
d/e

```

# Problem 3

Write code that will place the numbers 1 to 100 separately into a variable using for loop. Then, again using the seq function.

```{r}
# for loop solution
# i becomes the number 1 to 100 at each step of the loop


a <- length(100) # make empty variable, set length to 100
for (i in 1:100){
  a[i] <-i #assigns the number in i, to the ith index of a
}

print(a)

# for loop solution #2

a<-c() #create empty variable using combine command
for (i in 1:100){
  a<-c(a,i) # keeps combining a with itself and the new number in i
}
print(a)

# seq solution
a <- seq(1,100,1) # look up help for seq using ?seq() in console
print(a)

```

# Problem 4

Find the sum of all the integer numbers from 1 to 100.

```{r}
sum(1:100)
```

# Problem 5

Write a function to find the sum of all integers between any two values.

```{r}
mySum<- function (x) {
  totalSum<-0
  for (i in x){
    totalSum<-totalSum+i
  }
  return(totalSum)
}
test<-c(1:20)
mySum(test)
```

# Problem 6

List all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100. with and without seq function
  With seq:

```{r}
seq(1,by=2, len=100)
```

  Without Seq:
```{r}

for (i in 1:100) {
  if (i %% 2 ==1) print(i)
}

```
  
# Problem 7

List all of the prime numbers from 1 to 1000.
```{r}

prime_numbers <- function(n) {
if (n >= 2) {
 x = seq(2, n)
 prime_nums = c()
 for (i in seq(2, n)) {
 if (any(x == i)) {
 prime_nums = c(prime_nums, i)
 x = c(x[(x %% i) != 0], i)
 }
 }
 return(prime_nums)
 }
 else 
 {
 stop("Input number should be at least 2.")
 }
 } 
prime_numbers(100)

```
# Problem 8

Generate 100 Random Numbers

```{r}
runif(100)
```
# Problem 9
Generate 100 random numbers within a specific rang
```{r}
runif(100, min = 0, max = 1000)
```
# Problem 10
Write your own functions to give descriptive statistics for a vector variable storing multiple numbers. Write functions for the following without using R intrinsic: mean, mode, median, range, standard deviation
  
  Mean:
```{r}
mean_A <- function(x){
  return(sum(x)/length(x))
}

some_numbers <- c(1:100)
mean_A(some_numbers)
```
  Median:
```{r}
median (1:101)
```
  Mode:
```{r}
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

v <- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3,3,3,3,3)

result <- getmode(v)
print(result)
```
  Range:
```{r}
v <- c(112,132,143,214,115,263,73,81,329,12,13,113,321,2214,223,433,4325,4215)
{max(v)-min(v)}
```
# Problem 11
Count the number of characters in a string variable

```{r}
a <- c("adskfjhkadsjfh")
strsplit(a,split="")
```
# Problem 12
Count the number of words in a string variable
```{r}
a <- "this is a sentence"
strsplit(a,split=" ")
```
# Problem 13
Count the number of sentences in a string variable
```{r}
a <- "this is a sentence. i dont know if its good. if its bad too bad."
strsplit(a,split=" ")
```
# Problem 14
Count the number of times a specific character occurs in a string variable
```{r}
a <- c(1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,4,3,4,5,6,7)
table(a)
sum(a)
```
# Problem 15
Do a logical test to see if one word is found within the text of another string variable.
```{r}
a<- c(4,3,1,5,6,2,7,6,8,9,11,12,14,24,54)
b<- 4
c<- 10

c%in%a
b%in%a
```
# Problem 16
Put the current computer time in milliseconds into a variable
```{r}
print(as.numeric(Sys.time())*1, digits=3)
```
# Problem 17
Measure how long a piece of code takes to run by measuring the time before the code is run, and after the code is run, and taking the difference to find the total time
```{r}
a<- Sys.time()
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
b<- Sys.time()
b-a
```
# Problem 18
Read a .txt file or .csv file into a variable
SKIPPED

# Problem 19
Output the contents of a variable to a .txt file
```{r}
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
write.csv(samples)
```


# Problem 20
Create a variable that stores a 20x20 matrix of random numbers
```{r}
a <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=20,nrow=20)
```


# Problem 21
Output any matrix to a txt file using commas or tabs to separate column values, and new lines to separate row values
```{r}
a <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=20,nrow=20)
write.csv(a)
```


# Problem 1
The FizzBuzz Problem. List the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following constraints. If the number can be divided by three evenly, then print Fizz instead of the number. If the number can be divided by five evenly, then print Buzz instead of the number. Finally, if the number can be divided by three and five evenly, then print FizzBuzz instead of the number.
```{r}
for (i in 1:100){
  
  if(i%%3 == 0 & i%%5 == 0) {
    print('FizzBuzz')
  }
  else if(i%%3 == 0) {
    print('Fizz')
  }
  else if (i%%5 == 0){
    print('Buzz')
  }
  else {
    print(i)
  }
}

```

# Problem 2
Take text as input, and be able to produce a table that shows the counts for each character in the text. This problem is related to the earlier easy problem asking you to count the number of times that a single letter appears in a text. The slightly harder problem is the more general version: count the frequencies of all unique characters in a text.
```{r}
a<-"Batman is a better superhero than Superman"
table(unlist(strsplit(a,split="")))
```
# Problem 3
Test the random number generator for a flat distribution. Generate a few million random numbers between 0 and 100. Count the number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. all the way up to 100. Look at the counts for each of the numbers and determine if they are relatively equal. For example, you could plot the counts in Excel to make a histogram. If all of the bars are close to being flat, then each number had an equal chance of being selected, and the random number generator is working without bias.
```{r}
a<-runif(1000000,0,100)
hist(a)
```
