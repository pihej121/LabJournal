# Patrick's Journal 
Made to keep a record of my practice with coding by displaying my practice code questions, answers and future pieces of code



# Problem 1

Do simple math with numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

```{r}
1+2
2*5
5/3
(1+6+4)/5

```

# Problem 2

Put numbers into variables, do simple math on the variables

```{r}
a<-1
b<-2
a+b

d<-c(1,2,3)
e<-c(5,6,7)
d+e
d*e
d/e

```

# Problem 3

Write code that will place the numbers 1 to 100 separately into a variable using for loop. Then, again using the seq function.

```{r}
# for loop solution
# i becomes the number 1 to 100 at each step of the loop


a <- length(100) # make empty variable, set length to 100
for (i in 1:100){
  a[i] <-i #assigns the number in i, to the ith index of a
}

print(a)

# for loop solution #2

a<-c() #create empty variable using combine command
for (i in 1:100){
  a<-c(a,i) # keeps combining a with itself and the new number in i
}
print(a)

# seq solution
a <- seq(1,100,1) # look up help for seq using ?seq() in console
print(a)

```

# Problem 4

Find the sum of all the integer numbers from 1 to 100.

```{r}
sum(1:100)
```

# Problem 5

Write a function to find the sum of all integers between any two values.

```{r}
mySum<- function (x) {
  totalSum<-0
  for (i in x){
    totalSum<-totalSum+i
  }
  return(totalSum)
}
test<-c(1:20)
mySum(test)
```

# Problem 6

List all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100. with and without seq function
  With seq:

```{r}
seq(1,by=2, len=100)
```

  Without Seq:
```{r}

for (i in 1:100) {
  if (i %% 2 ==1) print(i)
}

```
  
# Problem 7

List all of the prime numbers from 1 to 1000.
```{r}

prime_numbers <- function(n) {
if (n >= 2) {
 x = seq(2, n)
 prime_nums = c()
 for (i in seq(2, n)) {
 if (any(x == i)) {
 prime_nums = c(prime_nums, i)
 x = c(x[(x %% i) != 0], i)
 }
 }
 return(prime_nums)
 }
 else 
 {
 stop("Input number should be at least 2.")
 }
 } 
prime_numbers(100)

```
# Problem 8

Generate 100 Random Numbers

```{r}
runif(100)
```
# Problem 9

```{r}
runif(100, min = 0, max = 1000)
```
# Problem 10
Write your own functions to give descriptive statistics for a vector variable storing multiple numbers. Write functions for the following without using R intrinsic: mean, mode, median, range, standard deviation
  
  Mean:
```{r}
mean_A <- function(x){
  return(sum(x)/length(x))
}

some_numbers <- c(1:100)
mean_A(some_numbers)
```
  Median:
```{r}
median (1:101)
```
  Mode:
```{r}
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

v <- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3,3,3,3,3)

result <- getmode(v)
print(result)
```
  Range:
```{r}
v <- c(112,132,143,214,115,263,73,81,329,12,13,113,321,2214,223,433,4325,4215)
{max(v)-min(v)}
```

strsplit(a,split="")
```
# Problem 12
Count the number of words in a string variable

a <- "this is a sentence"
strsplit(a,split=" ")
```
# Problem 13
Count the number of sentences in a string variable
```{r}
a <- "this is a sentence. i dont know if its good. if its bad too bad."
strsplit(a,split=" ")
```
# Problem 14

sum(a)
```
# Problem 15
Do a logical test to see if one word is found within the text of another string variable.
```{r}
a<- c(4,3,1,5,6,2,7,6,8,9,11,12,14,24,54)
b<- 4
c<- 10

c%in%a
b%in%a
```
# Problem 16
Put the current computer time in milliseconds into a variable
```{r}
print(as.numeric(Sys.time())*1, digits=3)
```
# Problem 17
Measure how long a piece of code takes to run by measuring the time before the code is run, and after the code is run, and taking the difference to find the total time
```{r}
a<- Sys.time()
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
b<- Sys.time()
b-a
```
# Problem 18
Read a .txt file or .csv file into a variable
SKIPPED

# Problem 19

```{r}
samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
hist(samples)
write.csv(samples)
```


# Problem 20
Create a variable that stores a 20x20 matrix of random numbers
```{r}
a <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=20,nrow=20)
```


# Problem 21

```{r}
a <- matrix(runif(100), ncol=20,nrow=20)
write.csv(a)
```


# Problem 1
The FizzBuzz Problem. List the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following constraints. If the number can be divided by three evenly, then print Fizz instead of the number. If the number can be divided by five evenly, then print Buzz instead of the number. Finally, if the number can be divided by three and five evenly, then print FizzBuzz instead of the number.
```{r}
for (i in 1:100){
  
  if(i%%3 == 0 & i%%5 == 0) {
    print('FizzBuzz')
  }
  else if(i%%3 == 0) {
    print('Fizz')
  }
  else if (i%%5 == 0){
    print('Buzz')
  }
  else {
    print(i)
  }
}

```

# Problem 2
Take text as input, and be able to produce a table that shows the counts for each character in the text. This problem is related to the earlier easy problem asking you to count the number of times that a single letter appears in a text. The slightly harder problem is the more general version: count the frequencies of all unique characters in a text.
```{r}
a<-"Batman is a better superhero than Superman"
table(unlist(strsplit(a,split="")))
```
# Problem 3
Test the random number generator for a flat distribution. Generate a few million random numbers between 0 and 100. Count the number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. all the way up to 100. Look at the counts for each of the numbers and determine if they are relatively equal. For example, you could plot the counts in Excel to make a histogram. If all of the bars are close to being flat, then each number had an equal chance of being selected, and the random number generator is working without bias.
```{r}
a<-runif(1000000,0,100)
hist(a)
```
### Practice Statistics Lab Exercises

# Lab 1: 

Problem 1: Compute the sum of the sequence 100 to 1000, going up by a constant value of 100 (100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000).
```{r}
sum(seq(100,1000,100))
```
Problem 2: Compute the sum of these numbers (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)

```{r}
sum(1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```
Problem 3: Write a custom sequence generator function using a for loop that generates a sequence from a starting integer value to an ending integer value in steps of 1. Demonstrate that it can produce the sequence 1 to 10.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  if(i <= 10){
    print(i)
  } else {
    break
  }
}
```
Problem 4: Write a custom function to implement the following general equation to find the sum of any constant series:
```{r}
sum(seq(100,1000,2))
```
Problem 5: Write a custom function that generates a constant series between any start and end values, with any constant, and finds the sum. Have your function output both the sequence and the sum. For this problem, feel free to use the existing seq() and sum() functions in your custom function. Demonstrate the function correctly prints out the above sequence (10 to 100 in steps of 10), and its sum.
```{r}
seq(10,100,10)
sum(seq(10,100,10))
```
Problem 6: Use the sum() and the length() functions to calculate the mean (average) of the numbers x = c(1,2,3,4,5).
```{r}

c<- (1:5)
sum(1:5)/length(c)


```


# Lab 2:

Problem 1:
Use R to demonstrate that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. Accomplish the following steps:

a. Produce a sample of at least 10 or more different numbers
b. Produce a sample of at least 10 or more different numbers
c. Produce a simulation following the example from the concepts section
d. Use your simulation to test a range of numbers smaller and larger than the      mean to show that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from     the mean.
e. Plot your results.
```{R}
scores<- sample(1:20, 64, replace=TRUE)

min(scores)

max(scores)

numbers_to_test <- min(scores):max(scores)

sum_deviations <-c() # create an empty vector to store sums
for(i in numbers_to_test) {
  sum_deviations[i] <- sum(scores-i)
}

sum_deviations

sd(scores)

plot(abs(sum_deviations))

```

Problem 2: Write a custom R function for any one of the following descriptive statistics: median, mode, standard deviation, variance. Demonstrate that it produces the same value as the base R function given some set of numbers.

```{R}
c<- (1:10) 
Mymean<- mean(c)
Mymean

mymean1<- (sum(c)/length(c))
mymean1


median(c)



my_median <- function(C){
   x <- sort(C)
   if((length(C) %% 2) == 0){
    return((C[length(C)/2] + C[length(C)/2 + 1]) / 2)
   }
   else{
     return(C[(length(C)/2) + 0.5])
   }
}
```
